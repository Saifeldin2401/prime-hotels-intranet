## 6. Submission & Review Workflow
PRIME Hotels maintains high quality through a mandatory review process for specific roles.

1.  **Draft:** Save your work without others seeing it.
2.  **Submit for Review:** 
    - If you are a **Department Head** or **Property HR**, your article will be sent to the **Review Queue**.
    - Reviewers (General Managers or Regional Admins) will be notified immediately.
3.  **Status Tracking:**
    - `Draft`: Only you can see it.
    - `Pending Review`: Waiting for manager approval.
    - `Published`: Live and visible to the target audience.
    - `Rejected`: Needs corrections based on feedback.

## 7. The Review Queue (For Managers)
Managers responsible for quality control can access the **Content Review Queue**.

### Review Actions:
- **Approve & Publish:** The article goes live immediately.
- **Request Changes:** Send the article back to the author with specific comments on what to improve.
- **Reject:** Archive the article if it is no longer relevant or incorrect.

**Feedback Loop:** Always provide clear comments when requesting changes or rejecting an article to help the author understand the required standards.

---

## 8. Acknowledgment & Compliance
For "High-Stakes" documents (like Safety Protocols or Legal Policies), you can enable **"Requires Acknowledgment"**.

- **Staff View:** When reading the article, staff will see a prominent "I Acknowledge" button.
- **Tracking:** The system logs the exact timestamp when each employee acknowledges they have read and understood the document.
- **Analytics:** Managers can view compliance reports to see which team members have yet to complete their required reading.
