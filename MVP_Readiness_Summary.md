## 🏛 Regulatory Foundations
All content is anchored in the following authoritative sources:
1. **Ministry of Tourism (MT)**: Royal Decree M/175 (2025 Standards).
2. **Ministry of HR (MHRSD)**: Saudization (Nitaqat) Guide 2025.
3. **SDAIA**: Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL).
4. **Saudi Building Code (SBC 801)**: Fire & Life Safety requirements.

## 🛠 Next Steps
1. **Apply Indices**: Run the SQL commands in `injection_plan.json` to optimize search performance for Arabic text.
2. **Batch Import**: Use the `/import-content` edge function to inject `content_bundle.json` into the production environment.
3. **Property Verification**: While content is "REAL/VERIFIED", specific properties must confirm their custom "House Rules" via the `PropertySettings` page.

## ⚠️ High-Priority Risks
- **Qiwa Integration**: Direct API access to government portals requires specific client-side credentials. Handled as "Medium Priority" in the backlog.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the app's server location complies with the SDAIA PDPL requirement for localized data storage within Saudi borders.
